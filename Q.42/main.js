// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a
//  function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
//  the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see
//   that the list has actually been modified.
// initialized the magicians names in an array
var magiciansName = ["ALbert", "Carlos", "Johnson"];
//made a function which takes magicians as a perameter
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magicians) {
        console.log(magicians);
    });

function make_great(magicians) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians.length; i++) {
        magicians[i] = magicians[i] + " " + "the Great";
    }
}
