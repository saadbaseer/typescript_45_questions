// Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the 
// beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character 
// combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the
//  whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping 
//  the white spaces.
var person_Name = "\t\t\tSaad Baseer\n\t";
//printed with whitespaces
console.log(person_Name);
//used trim method to remove whitespaces
console.log(person_Name.trim());
